# towrecen
The towrecen code characterizes the scatter in data by quantifying the dispersion with respect to some fiducial value. There are two possible approaches which `towrecen` implements:
+ determine the (signed) minimal orthogonal distance between each datum and some reference function
+ determine the orthogonal distance which maximizes the variance with respect to the mean or median of the data

The former involves root-finding to determine _where_ a function gets minimized. This approach is inherently model-dependent. The latter lends itself naturally to principal component analysis (PCA -- perhaps a foregone conclusion for the stats-oriented folks). This approach is model-independent. There are pros and cons to each approach, and it is up to the user to determine which method is more insightful/meaningful given their data and objectives.

In the case of the explicity orthogonal distance method, if no model is provided, `towrecen` will produce a model by performing a Demming regression fit, which assumes a simle first-order polynomial and accounts for scatter and uncertainty in both the abscissa (independent) and ordinate (dependent) variables. PCA implicitly contains a similar "fit" when reprojecting the data via spectral decomposition. The best-"fit" coefficients are contained in the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the dependent and independent variables. This PCA "fit" is equivalent to total least squares and is often similar (but not the same) as Demming regression.

## Example Usage
``` python
from numpy.random import rand, randn, seed
from towrecen import *
seed(123)
import sys,os
# function for orthogonal distance
# here using Nicholls+ 2017
f = lambda x: log10(10**-1.732+10**((x-12)+2.19))
# generate fake data
x  = 1.5*rand(50)+7.5
y  = f(x) + randn(len(x))*0.25
xe = 0.05*rand(len(x))+0.05
ye = 0.05*rand(len(x))+0.05
# instantiate towrecen
disp = towrecen(x,y,fun=f,xerr=xe,yerr=ye)
# plot data to illustrate scatter and
# minimized Euclidean distances
disp.plotDistOrtho()
```

## Whence the Name `towrecen`
I studied Old, Middle, and Early Modern English in college, both from a linguistic angle and from a literary one. I wanted to reconnect to those scholastic roots. The name `towrecen` is an Old English word meaning 'to scatter' or 'to disperse'. The word contains connotations of sowing fields. I often picture data as having been scattered in such a way, with the Universe casting galactic seeds to be nurtured through gas accretion and the subtle laws of physics. Ours is to determine whether the dispersion is physical (like the mass-metallicity relation) and if so, why.

## Citing `towrecen`
The `towrecen` code has its origins in my Master's thesis; however, it first appeared "publicly" in the publication below. As of now, please cite this paper when utilizing `towrecen`.
